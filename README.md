Project summarization 
	The purpose of this project was to create an application for AirGead Banking in this scenario the application should be designed so that, 
	the user can enter investment information. The information should display the investment growth over time. 

What I did particularly well, was the design of the application, this let me practice separating code into different files. 
This way the main file looks much more organized and legible.

What I could improve on is the user inputs when the application asks the user if they would like to continue. 

What I found most challenging when writing this code was creating the separate classes and creating the validations for those functions. For example, 
I had to validate when a user enters a number that has to be positive and also a number. 
How I overcame this challenge was by conducting research for user validations and that’s when I learned about operator overrides. Tools I have added to
my support network are online sources with additional information about operators.

The problem-solving skill and research methods are what will transfer to other projects. 
Along with Classes, file separations, and the concepts of operator overrides/user validations. 

How I made the program maintainable was by creating classes for the different calculations. 
I made it more legible by adding inline comments and appropriate variable/class names. 
And since the files are separate you can create a program with new classes In the main file which makes it more adaptable.
